task-6
The AI & ML Internship introduces the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for solving classification problems. Using a dataset like the Iris dataset, the task involves **normalizing features** to ensure accurate distance calculations, which are essential to how KNN works. Participants must train models using the `KNeighborsClassifier` from scikit-learn, **experiment with different values of K**, and evaluate performance using metrics like **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**. Additionally, the task encourages visualizing **decision boundaries** to better understand how the algorithm classifies data based on proximity. Through this task, learners gain practical experience with **instance-based learning**, understand the impact of **K selection**, and explore the **role of distance metrics** in model behavior.
